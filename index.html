        <p> I am currently 17 years old and enrolled as a Junior (11th Grade) at High School, I have an interest in programming and its applications. I find it amazing and fun to explore the possibilities of coding and am eager to contribute to the field's advancements later on in life after getting my degree in Software Engineering at hopefully UT Austin!</p>
